## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List the prerequisites that users need to have installed on their system before they can run your app. For example:

- Python 3.x
- pip

Include instructions or links to installation guides for these prerequisites.

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install your application. This might include:

1. Cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-app.git
   ```

2. Navigating to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-app
   ```

3. Installing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

Explain how to run your application using both FastAPI and Flask. Include separate sections for each framework.

### FastAPI

1. Navigate to the `app` directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Flask

1. Navigate to the `app` directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   flask run
